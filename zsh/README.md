# tz-zshconfig

Almost done. Startup costs 0.18s.

## Why not use `oh-my-zsh`?

It prevent me from customizing the Zsh the way I want, i.e., setup my own zsh configuration from bottom up.

Another drawback for me is that each time after updating oh-my-zsh I could find lots of useless files has been modified.

For pursuing a minimal and clean config, I decide to setup my own config. It's not easy but really fun.

By setting up your own config, you will learn:

1. Zsh prompt configuration

2. Zsh prompt variables

3. bash-compatible zsh script
